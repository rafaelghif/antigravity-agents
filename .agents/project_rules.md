# Project Architecture Blueprint (PAB)

This file defines the specific technical stack, directory boundaries, coding standards, and system dependencies for this project.

---

## 1. Stack & Directory Boundaries
- **Primary Language/Framework**: Unknown
- **Directory Structure**:
  - `tests/` -> Project workspace component
  - `config/` -> Project workspace component

## 2. Architectural Conventions
- **Architectural Pattern**: Standard Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Boundary insulation**: Core domain logic must remain completely independent of external libraries, databases, and frameworks.

## 3. Spacing & Styling Standards
- **Linter command**: `echo 'No linter found'`
- **Build validation**: `echo 'No build command needed'`
- **Test runner command**: `echo 'No test suite found'`
- **Follow formatting**: Follow standard formatting guidelines for Unknown development.

## 4. Security & External Services
- **Database/ORM**: None detected
- **Required Configuration Variables**:
  - No configuration parameters detected.

## 5. Long-Term Impact & 10-Year Maintainability Gates
- **Impact-Analysis Check**: Before installing new packages, modifying database structures, or altering cross-domain APIs, the agent must run the `impact-analysis` skill and document design rationales.
- **Architectural Boundary Gate**: Domain business logic must remain completely independent of libraries and frameworks (e.g. database schemas, server frameworks).
- **Code Sustainability**: Code must prioritize long-term readability over brevity. Avoid complex runtime assumptions, unverified imports, or undocumented configuration requirements.
- **Ambiguity Gate**: If any implementation details are unclear, halt and ask the user for confirmation first.
