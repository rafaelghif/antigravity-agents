# 2. Write AGENTS.md (Global Agent Protocol) to project root
cat << 'EOF' > AGENTS.md
# Global Agent Protocol (GAP)

This document dictates the absolute boundaries, operational procedures, memory constraints, and quality gates for all AI agent operations in this workspace. Compliance is mandatory for every agent execution.

---

## 1. Bootstrapping & Cognitive Alignment
- **Autonomous Bootstrapping**: At the beginning of any session or task context, the agent MUST read:
  1. The Global Agent Protocol (this file: [AGENTS.md](file://./AGENTS.md)).
  2. The Project-Specific Rules, if available (e.g. [.agents/project_rules.md](file://./.agents/project_rules.md)).
  3. The Schema Reference database, if available (e.g. [.agents/schema.md](file://./.agents/schema.md)).
  4. The Active Memory Ledger ([.agents/memory.md](file://./.agents/memory.md)).
- **Autonomy Principle**: The agent must rely on these documents and the codebase layout rather than asking the user repetitive or basic design questions. If a design pattern is missing or a user's instruction is ambiguous, default to standard industry best practices or ask a direct, clear multiple-choice question.

---

## 2. Zero-Hallucination & Import Verification Gates
- **Fact-Checking over Guessing**: Never assume a file exists, a package is installed, or a function signature is correct.
- **Symbol Verification Gate**: Before writing an import statement or invoking a function, the agent MUST run `view_file` or `grep_search` to verify:
  1. The path exists.
  2. The exact spelling of the exported symbol/module.
- **verbatim Reference**: When documenting compile, lint, or test failures, paste the exact stack traces and logs verbatim instead of describing them in general terms.

---

## 3. AI Prompt Caching & Token Optimization
To maximize prompt execution speed, leverage model-side context caching, and avoid token exhaustion, agents must strictly follow these caching protocols:
- **Cache-Friendly Memory Split**: Decouple static files (`AGENTS.md`, `project_rules.md`, `adr.md`) from dynamic ones. Static files must remain stable to hit 100% prompt cache.
- **Active Memory Cap**: Keep [.agents/memory.md](file://./.agents/memory.md) under 100 lines at all times. Once a milestone is achieved, immediately archive the checklist to [.agents/archive/](file://./.agents/archive/).
- **Targeted File Reads**: NEVER read entire source files when looking for small details. Always use precise `StartLine` and `EndLine` parameters in file-viewing tools to preserve prefix cache hits.
- **Persistent Terminal Shells**: Reuse active terminal sessions by passing `RunPersistent: true` and specifying `RequestedTerminalID`. This avoids spawning new bash subshells, which bloats terminal history logs.

---

## 4. Multi-Agent & Teamwork Coordination
To operate seamlessly in collaborative environments with other developers and autonomous agents:
- **Isolated Feature Branches**: All development must occur on separate, isolated git feature branches. Directly committing to `main` or `master` is strictly forbidden.
- **Federated Git-Backed Memory**: Memory resides in the repository. Pulling remote updates (`git pull --rebase origin main`) automatically syncs schemas, decision records, and active task progress across the entire team without needing external databases.
- **Active Lockfile Protocol**: To prevent parallel agents/developers from editing the same module:
  - Acquire the lock by running `.agents/scripts/helper.sh lock <module_name>`. This creates a lockfile under `.agents/locks/<module_name>.lock`.
  - Before editing any file, check if a lock exists. If it does, do NOT proceed. Coordinate with the lock owner, wait for release, or notify the user.
  - Release the lock immediately upon committing your changes by running `.agents/scripts/helper.sh unlock <module_name>`.
- **Pre-Merge Compaction Protocol**: To prevent merge conflicts on `memory.md` during integration:
  - Before merging a branch into `main`/`master`, the agent/developer MUST archive their active task checklist by running `.agents/scripts/helper.sh archive`.
  - This automatically saves the checklist to `.agents/archive/sprint_<branch_name>.md` and resets the active checklist in `memory.md`.
  - Commit this compaction: `chore(memory): archive active checklists for merge`.
- **Peer Review Handover**: When submitting a PR, the agent/developer must write a review guide at `.agents/workflows/pr_review_<branch_name>.md` detailing:
  1. **Scope of Work**: Added/modified files and symbols.
  2. **Verification Logs**: Verbatim test suite outputs proving compilation and test completion.
  3. **Schema Changes**: Visual mappings of any table/field modifications.
  4. **Code References**: Clickable file links pointing to key files for review.

---

## 5. Stateful Task Checklist
The active checklist inside [.agents/memory.md](file://./.agents/memory.md) must strictly follow this lifecycle:
- `[ ]` **Unstarted**: Proposed task.
- `[/]` **In Progress**: Active task. **CRITICAL**: Only ONE task can be marked `[/]` at a time. The agent must focus 100% on this task.
- `[x]` **Completed**: Done, verified, and committed.

---

## 6. The Atomic Commit Loop (Strict Discipline)
Every code mutation must execute in an atomic, sequential loop:
1. **Sync**: Rebase the branch to sync with remote updates (`git pull --rebase origin main`).
2. **Lock**: Run `.agents/scripts/helper.sh lock <module>` and set the target task to `[/]` in `memory.md`.
3. **Edit**: Modify a single file or write a test (under TDD guidelines).
4. **Compile & Test**: Run local validation commands. If tests fail, go back to step 3.
5. **Commit**: Stage and commit using conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`. Note: The installed Git `post-commit` hook will automatically execute `.agents/scripts/helper.sh sync-git` to keep `memory.md` updated.
6. **Sync Memory**: Update [.agents/memory.md](file://./.agents/memory.md) task checklist to `[x]` and update `schema.md` (if database columns or API routes changed).
7. **Unlock**: Run `.agents/scripts/helper.sh unlock <module>`.

---

## 7. Self-Correction & Troubleshooting Playbook
If build tools, linters, or test suites crash, run this diagnostic checklist:
1. **Identify Module Context**: Determine if the crash is inside the frontend, backend, or database migrations container.
2. **Review Environment Configs**: Verify if `.env` values or docker containers are running and healthy.
3. **Trace Missing Imports**: If compiler reports missing types/packages, search the package configs (`package.json`, `go.mod`, etc.) to check if dependencies were installed or if aliases (e.g., tsconfig paths) are resolved correctly.
4. **Mock External Outages**: During test execution, mock external API dependencies (payment gateways, Firebase, AWS S3, etc.) to ensure tests run deterministically and fast without hitting real remote services.

---

## 8. Self-Improvement & Meta-Refactoring Protocol
The agent must continuously optimize its own tools, protocols, and developer guidelines to maintain a 1% world-class execution standard:
- **Refinement Triggers**: If a lint error, type mismatch, or testing bottleneck repeats more than 3 times, the agent MUST immediately refine [.agents/project_rules.md](file://./.agents/project_rules.md) or update the respective skill file to document the solution permanently.
- **Dynamic Skill Creation**: If the agent identifies a missing capability (e.g. a skill for code auditing, packaging, or migration validation), it must proactively define it under `.agents/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md` and use it.
- **Grounding Gate**: All proposed self-improvements and optimizations must be 100% realistic and functional. Do not suggest or create configurations for tools that are not installed or are unavailable in the workspace environment.

---

## 9. Modular Document Grouping (Domain-Driven Schemas)
To optimize prompt caching and prevent context window bloat:
- **Index Reference**: The main [.agents/schema.md](file://./.agents/schema.md) file acts strictly as a high-level index mapping domain-specific database and API layouts.
- **Domain Segmentation**: Schemas and contracts must be grouped by function under [.agents/schemas/](file://./.agents/schemas/) (e.g., `admin_and_auth.md`, `assets_and_taxonomy.md`).
- **Targeted Reading**: When modifying a resource, the agent MUST ONLY load the relevant domain schema file. Loading the entire database schema map for localized edits is strictly forbidden.
- **Incremental Growth**: These domain-specific schemas grow incrementally when new modules are registered under the schema index map.

---

## 10. Autonomous Adaptation & Self-Configuration Protocol
When the agent starts execution in a workspace, it must check if the project-specific blueprints (.agents/project_rules.md and .agents/schema.md) are either missing, empty, or contain default templates.
If the blueprints are not initialized for the current project:
1. **Trigger Reconnaissance**: Immediately execute the `codebase-recon` skill to discover the project's language, framework, folder structure, config files, and relational database migrations/schemas.
2. **Populate Project Blueprint**:
   - Write the discovered technical stack, directories boundary gate, and validation commands (build, test, lint) directly into [.agents/project_rules.md](file://./.agents/project_rules.md).
3. **Populate Database Schema Map**:
   - Map all relational database models, tables, columns, and API routes found, and organize them into specialized domain-driven schemas under [.agents/schemas/](file://./.agents/schemas/).
   - Update the high-level index map inside [.agents/schema.md](file://./.agents/schema.md) to link to these domain schemas.
4. **Initialize Active Memory**:
   - Populate [.agents/memory.md](file://./.agents/memory.md) with the detected system topology, active branch, and initial task list.
5. **Autoprovision Commit**: Commit these initialized configuration files using git: `chore(agent): autodetect project stack and initialize memory blueprints`.
Once the blueprints are populated, the agent must strictly follow the detected project rules for all code mutations.

# Codebase Reconnaissance Skill

## 1. Input Specification
- **Search Path Target**: Workspace root folder.
- **Exclusion Filters**: Ignore all build/transient files or package locks (`node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `package-lock.json`, `.git`, etc.).

## 2. Operational Procedures
1. **Directory Structure Discovery**:
   - Scan workspace root to locate key configuration files (e.g. `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `composer.json`, `gemfile`).
   - Identify active subprojects, monorepo partitions, or key folder boundaries (e.g. `src/`, `apps/`, `lib/`, `controllers/`, `views/`).
2. **Environment Profile Scanning**:
   - Inspect `.env.example`, `config/` files, or Docker Compose setups to map system dependencies (databases, caching hosts, external APIs, object storage).
3. **Relational & API Contract Mapping**:
   - Scan for data models, ORM entities, or database schemas (e.g., `.entity.ts`, `.go` models, migrations folder, SQL scripts).
   - Scan for API routes, controller files, or GraphQL schemas to map available endpoints.
4. **Boundary Verification**:
   - Verify decoupling boundaries. Confirm that frontend layers do not directly import backend files, and business domains remain insulated from framework-specific wrappers.

## 3. Decision Matrix
- **Are there database schema definitions?**
   - **YES**: Limit scanning to folders containing database configuration, entities, or migration scripts.
- **Are there separate frontend and backend workspaces?**
   - **YES**: Document their distinct routes, ports, run environments, and interface sharing mechanisms.
- **Are there environment variables?**
   - **YES**: Cross-reference `.env.example` with the active configuration loading files to ensure matching parameters.

## 4. Error Mitigation Tree
- **No package configurations found at workspace root**:
  - *Mitigation*: Fall back to recursive search for nested workspaces up to level-3 subdirectories.
- **Alias imports are unresolved**:
  - *Mitigation*: Consult compiler/bundler configurations (e.g. `tsconfig.json` paths, webpack alias, vite config) to resolve path mappings.

## 5. Output Protocol
Save the reconnaissance summary in the project's memory ledger (e.g., `schema.md` or a codebase map section in `memory.md`) detailing:
1. Workspace folders and project roles.
2. Relational database schema layout.
3. Active API endpoints and contract directories.
4. Build tools and local testing environment commands.

# Git Operations Skill

## 1. Input Specification
- **Operation Scope**: Feature development, bug fixing, refactoring, or infrastructure adjustments.
- **Changed Files List**: Selected list of files modified during the current subtask.
- **Target Branch**: Typically a feature branch branched off `main`/`master`.

## 2. Operational Procedures & Checklist
1. **Branch Hygiene & Naming Check**:
   - Ensure the current branch is **NOT** `main` or `master`.
   - The branch name must strictly conform to: `<type>/<kebab-case-description>` (e.g., `feat/firebase-integration`, `fix/cors-headers`, `chore/update-postgres-port`).
   - If currently on `main`, checkout a new branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
2. **Pre-Staging Verification**:
   - Run compilation and tests locally (e.g. `npm run build` / `npm run test` or language-equivalent tools) before staging any files.
3. **Secret Scan Check**:
   - Ensure you are not staging `.env`, `.env.local`, credentials files, or private keys.
   - Run `git status` to see untracked and modified files.
4. **Selective Staging**:
   - Stage files individually rather than staging all: `git add <path/to/modified/file>`.
   - Run `git diff --cached` to inspect lines added and verify that no debugging statements or temporary passwords are being committed.
5. **Commit Assembly**:
   - Compose the message strictly matching: `type(scope): description`
     - **Types**: `feat` (new features), `fix` (bug fixes), `refactor` (code restructuring), `chore` (infra, build tools, dependency adjustments, memory updates).
     - **Scopes**: Use the project-specific module name or workspace directory (e.g. `backend`, `frontend`, `infra`, `auth`, `shared`, `db`).
     - *Example*: `fix(frontend): adjust asset detail layout overlay overflow`
6. **Synchronize & Push**:
   - Pull remote changes using rebase to avoid unnecessary merge commits: `git pull --rebase origin main`.
   - Push branch to remote: `git push origin <active-branch-name>`.

## 3. Decision Matrix
- **Are there uncommitted changes on the active branch but we need to pull updates?**
   - **YES**: Stash changes: `git stash`, pull changes: `git pull --rebase origin main`, then restore: `git stash pop`.
- **Did a file containing private credentials get staged/committed?**
   - **YES**: Instantly stop and undo: `git reset HEAD~1` (if committed) or `git reset HEAD <file>` (if staged). Move keys into `.env` and add the filename to `.gitignore`.
- **Does a merge conflict occur during a pull?**
   - **YES**: Resolve conflicts in files. Compile/Test to verify resolution. Then `git add <resolved_files>` and `git rebase --continue`. Never force-push (`-f` / `--force`) to shared branches.

## 4. Error Mitigation Tree
- **Detached HEAD State**:
   - *Mitigation*: Run `git checkout <branch-name>` immediately to re-anchor on the active tracking branch.
- **Accidental commit to `main` branch**:
   - *Mitigation*: Run `git branch temp-branch`, reset main back to remote state: `git reset --hard origin/main`, then switch back: `git checkout temp-branch`.

## 5. Output Protocol
Update the project's active memory ledger (`.agents/memory.md`) under the Git/version control section with the active branch, last commit hash, and target PR status.

# Test-Driven Patching Skill

## 1. Input Specification
- **Requirements/Defect Report**: Detailed description of the target behavior or bug description.
- **Target Files**: List of production source code files to modify.
- **Test Files**: Target path of corresponding spec or test files.
- **Mock Context**: List of external dependencies (e.g. database connections, external APIs, security middleware) to mock.

## 2. Operational Procedures & Checklist
1. **Red Phase (Write and Fail)**:
   - Identify or create the test/spec file corresponding to the target feature.
   - Write a unit test simulating the input and asserting the correct behavior or bug resolution.
   - Run the test runner command for the target language (e.g., `npm run test -- <path>`, `go test`, `pytest <path>`, `cargo test`). Verify that the test fails with a deterministic, expected assertion error.
2. **Green Phase (Implement and Pass)**:
   - Navigate to the production file.
   - Write the minimum amount of production code required to satisfy the unit test requirements and make it pass.
   - Re-run the test runner. Ensure the test passes successfully without side effects.
3. **Refactor Phase (Clean and Standardize)**:
   - Clean up code styles: eliminate duplicate lines, improve variable naming, optimize loops, and apply architectural spacing standards.
   - Run the test runner once more to confirm the code remains green.
4. **Coverage Analysis**:
   - Run coverage analysis commands if available.
   - Ensure the new modules or lines added satisfy the project's coverage threshold (typically >= 90%).
5. **Regression Verification**:
   - Run the project's global test suite across the active folder to verify no existing tests are broken.

## 3. Decision Matrix
- **Are we testing controllers or services guarded by authentication headers?**
   - **YES**: Mock or bypass the authorization guards inside the test container setup or pass valid mock JWT headers in the HTTP request simulator.
- **Are we testing database repositories or DB operations?**
   - **YES**: Use standard mock/stub repository adapters or an in-memory database configuration (e.g. SQLite in-memory, Go-sqlmock, mockito) to isolate tests from local databases.
- **Are we testing UI views or native components?**
   - **YES**: Mock native plugins, browser globals, or HTTP fetch clients to ensure tests run completely sandbox-isolated.

## 4. Error Mitigation Tree
- **Test environment crashes due to missing configuration variables**:
   - *Mitigation*: Ensure mock variables are loaded inside the test configuration setup block, or pass them inline to the execution environment.
- **Flaky or timing-sensitive asynchronous tests**:
   - *Mitigation*: Avoid using arbitrary sleep timers. Use built-in testing library virtual clocks/fake timers or wait for promise/goroutine resolutions explicitly.

## 5. Output Verification Gate
- [ ] Unit/Integration tests run green locally.
- [ ] Modified or added lines achieve target code coverage thresholds.
- [ ] Global regression suite passes without regression errors.

# Infrastructure Provisioner Skill

## 1. Input Specification
- **Environment Configuration**: A `.env` file containing credentials (e.g., database user, cache credentials, API endpoints).
- **Network Boundaries**: Bridged private network configurations for cross-container communication.

## 2. Operational Procedures & Checklist
1. **Compose File Construction**:
   - Write a `docker-compose.yml` at the repository root.
   - Set up standard containers based on project dependencies (e.g. database, cache, storage).
   - Configure named persistent volumes to preserve service state.
2. **Resource Constraints**:
   - Restrict memory and CPU usage per service in local development environments to prevent host resource exhaustion.
3. **Decoupled Healthchecks**:
   - Configure health checks to verify that each service is fully operational.
   - Define interval, timeout, retries, and start period windows.
4. **Service Startup Sequencing**:
   - Map dependencies explicitly using `depends_on` with the `condition: service_healthy` clause to ensure services boot in the correct order.
5. **Autoprovisioning Scripts**:
   - Set up auto-initialization scripts or containers (e.g., creating database tables, seeding mock data, setting up default storage buckets).

## 3. Decision Matrix
- **Is a required service already running on the host system?**
   - **YES**: Do **NOT** shut down host processes. Edit the port binding in the local container configuration (e.g., bind host port `5433` to container port `5432`) and update environment configs.
- **Do logs indicate initialization failures due to invalid credentials or volumes?**
   - **YES**: Stop container, purge invalid volumes (`docker compose down -v`), correct configuration values, and restart services.

## 4. Error Mitigation Tree
- **Container health check times out or fails**:
   - *Mitigation*: Run `docker compose logs <service-name>` to identify error logs. Common fixes include adjusting database permissions, increasing the health check `start_period`, or correcting credential mismatches.
- **Docker daemon is unresponsive**:
   - *Mitigation*: Run `docker info` to verify state. Prompt the user to ensure Docker is running.

## 5. Output Verification Gate
- Run validation check: `docker compose ps`. Verify all services are listed as healthy.
- Connect to database and cache dependencies to verify credentials.
- Record local infrastructure status in the active memory ledger (`.agents/memory.md`).

# Security & CI Compliance Audit Skill

## 1. Input Specification
- **Modified Source Code**: List of added or changed files in the active commit stack.
- **Project Configuration**: Environment validation files, API gateway bootstrap files, security middlewares.

## 2. Operational Procedures & Checklist
1. **Secret Scanning Pattern Match**:
   - Run grep pattern searches to identify hardcoded credentials:
     - Private key block indicators (e.g., `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`).
     - Files with credentials (e.g., `credential*.json`, `key*.json`, `.pem`).
     - Hardcoded password strings or credentials: `api_key`, `secret`, `password` assignments.
2. **Environment Variable Validation Audit**:
   - Scan the codebase for raw environment variable reads (e.g. `process.env` in JS/TS, `os.Getenv` in Go, `os.environ` in Python).
   - Verify that all environment configs are validated at application bootstrap using a schema validator or config loading service, avoiding raw access scattered across domain layers.
3. **API Documentation Audit**:
   - For all files modified under API boundary folders (e.g., controllers, handlers):
     - Verify properties and endpoints are documented with clear tags, JSDoc/Swagger comments, or annotations.
     - Verify response schemas and return status codes are explicitly declared.
4. **Domain Layer Purity Audit**:
   - Verify files inside core business domain layers have zero dependencies on frameworks, HTTP routers, or ORM annotations.
5. **Third-Party Isolation Audit (Frontend UI)**:
   - Verify UI components consume abstract client/adapter interfaces (e.g., wrapper hooks or service adapters) rather than importing raw HTTP clients or native device packages directly.
6. **Observability and Security Middleware Audit**:
   - Verify that the API gateway entrypoint initializes:
     - Security headers (e.g., Helmet, CORS rules restricting wildcards).
     - Global validation pipelines for incoming requests.
     - Rate-limiting (throttling) policies.
     - Dependency health check endpoints (checking database, cache, storage connectivity).

## 3. Decision Matrix
- **Was a raw environment variable access violation found?**
   - **YES**: Replace the raw access with the appropriate property retrieved from the config loading service, and register the new key in the schema loader if not already mapped.
- **Did a route handler miss API docs annotations?**
   - **YES**: Add the appropriate annotations or documentation blocks to ensure schema contract compliance.

## 4. Error Mitigation Tree
- **App fails to boot due to env validation errors**:
   - *Mitigation*: Inspect the validation logs. Copy missing parameters from the configuration example into your local `.env`, bind the correct value type, and re-run startup.

## 5. Output Verification Gate
- [ ] No private keys or credentials files are tracked in git.
- [ ] Direct environment variables access is strictly restricted to the configuration module.
- [ ] API endpoints and models explicitly declare return types and validation rules.
- [ ] Health Check endpoint tracks active services.
- [ ] Rate limiting and security headers are initialized at the gateway.

# Code Review & Quality Gate Skill

## 1. Input Specification
- **Modified Diffs**: Git diff list of staged or modified files.
- **Project Blueprints**: Config schemas, API docs specifications, and architectural rules.

## 2. Operational Procedures
1. **Source Code Auditing (Diff Check)**:
   - Run line-by-line checks on modified blocks to ensure:
     - No debugging remnants are left (`console.log`, `print`, `debugger`, raw print statements).
     - No hardcoded access credentials, passwords, or S3 key strings.
     - Comments are clean, professional, and explain non-obvious code paths.
2. **Type Safety & Cleanliness Audit**:
   - Verify that no type bypass methods are used (e.g. `any` in TypeScript, raw interface{} in Go, untyped variables where strict types are available).
   - Ensure all type casting is safe, and edge cases are handled (e.g. avoiding unchecked null/undefined property lookups).
3. **Architectural Boundary Gate**:
   - Check if database operations, frameworks, or security packages bleed into business use cases or core domain entities.
   - For web apps: Check if presenter UI components import network client classes (Axios, Fetch) directly instead of utilizing service wrappers or React Query adapters.
4. **Contract and API Docs Compliance**:
   - Confirm that DTOs utilize correct validation rules.
   - Confirm that API endpoints are decorated with clear descriptions, route mappings, and explicit return type schemas.
5. **Testing & Coverage Audit**:
   - Verify that test suites cover all newly added or modified methods.
   - Ensure mocks correctly isolate tests from running local databases or calling external third-party services.
   - Confirm global unit tests pass with zero failures.

## 3. Decision Matrix
- **Is there a type bypass or lint warning?**
  - **YES**: Stop the review. Reject the check. Instruct the agent/developer to declare strict interfaces or union types, and resolve lints.
- **Does the code bleed across boundaries?**
  - **YES**: Reject. Instruct to refactor using service/repository wrappers to keep layers decoupled.
- **Does it pass all checks and verification suites?**
  - **YES**: Accept. Approve the commit/PR.

## 4. Error Mitigation Tree
- **Global test suite fails during pre-commit checks**:
  - *Mitigation*: Identify the broken tests from console logs. If the error is due to changed mock inputs, update the specs. If it's a regression bug, revert the code change, diagnose, and fix.

## 5. Output Verification Gate
- [ ] Staged code compiles clean with no warnings/errors.
- [ ] Secrets and credential configurations are fully isolated.
- [ ] Newly added lines satisfy target code coverage limits.
- [ ] PR Review Handover document generated.
