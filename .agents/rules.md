# AAC V2 Project Rules

These rules extend the core guidelines in `AGENTS.md` with project-specific language and tool specifications.

## 1. Programming Language & Tools
- Use **Python 3.10+** for all CLI scripting.
- Rely on the standard library where possible to minimize external dependencies.
- Use **Bash** for lightweight POSIX-compatible wrapper scripts. Ensure path-separators and directory check logic are safe for multi-platform execution (e.g. using `python3` wrappers on Windows).

## 2. Style Guidelines & Linting
- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines for all Python code.
- Always include clear docstrings for public classes, modules, and functions.
- Keep functions short, focused, and under 50 lines where practical.

## 3. Testing Requirements
- Every new feature or command module MUST have corresponding unit tests under `tests/`.
- Tests must use standard `unittest` or `pytest` frameworks.
- Mock all filesystem or external command calls to ensure tests remain deterministic and fast.
