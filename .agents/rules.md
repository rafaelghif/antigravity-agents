# AAC V2 Project Rules

These rules extend the core guidelines in `AGENTS.md` with project-specific language and tool specifications.

## 1. Programming Language & Tools
- Use **Python 3** for the main product stack.
- Rely on the standard library where possible to minimize external dependencies.
- Use **Bash** for lightweight POSIX-compatible wrapper scripts. Ensure path-separators and directory check logic are safe for multi-platform execution (e.g. using `python3` wrappers on Windows).

## 2. Style Guidelines & Linting
- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines for all Python code.
- Always include clear docstrings for public classes, modules, and functions.
- Keep functions short, focused, and under 50 lines where practical.

## 3. Testing Requirements
- Every new feature or command module MUST have corresponding unit tests under `tests/`.
- Tests must use standard `unittest` or `pytest` frameworks.
- Mock all filesystem or external command calls to ensure tests remain deterministic and fast.

## 4. Plug-and-Play Adaptation & Self-Learning
- **Stack Adaptiveness**: The agent layout is project-agnostic. Use `bootstrap.py` to auto-detect and support any programming language stack (e.g. Python, Node, PHP, Go, Rust, Java, C#) without strict folder structure constraints.
- **Continuous Self-Learning**: After resolving any bug, workflow issue, or optimization, the agent MUST run `./helper.sh learn "<lesson>"` (optionally with `--category <name>`) to append the lesson in `.agents/memory/lessons-learned.md`. Always review this file at the start of work.
